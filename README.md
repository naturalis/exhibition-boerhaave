## Ansible

We use [Ansible](https://github.com/naturalis/exhibition-boerhaave/tree/master/ansible) to perform a one-off deployment of interactives on about 60
Linux devices in the exhibition of [Rijksmuseum Boerhaave](https://rijksmuseumboerhaave.nl/).

## Network

We [automated](https://github.com/naturalis/exhibition-boerhaave/tree/master/network) the procedure to add new reservations.

## Preseed

Alle interactives run on Ubuntu 16.04.3, which is installed by a [preseed file](https://github.com/naturalis/exhibition-boerhaave/tree/master/preseed) that we make.
